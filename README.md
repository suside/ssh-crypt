Share AES-256 encrypted vault file with your teammates using only ssh `authorized_keys`!

## Usage
```
$ echo "secret :)" | ssh-crypt edit --stdin -a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys VAULT.txt
$ cat VAULT.txt
dRAALGdpdGh1Yi5jb20vc3Vza...
$ ssh-crypt view VAULT.txt
secret :)
```

## Install

Download binary release https://github.com/suside/ssh-crypt/releases/latest
or install with `go` from master branch:
```
go get github.com/suside/ssh-crypt
```

## Why
  * Sharing Keepass with one master password is a no go...
  * Not everyone have/want pgp keys...
  * ...

## Inspiration
This is cheeky rewrite of great [ssh-vault](https://github.com/ssh-vault/ssh-vault) with less features **but** with support of multiple key pairs.
